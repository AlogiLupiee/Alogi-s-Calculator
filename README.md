> My small attempt at creating an easy and simple calculator app with option for a virtual keyboard.

## Backstory and motivations

The app was created as my first "major" app in python. I implemented my ideas one by one, to create a fun project mainly focusing on learning python in a fun way, instead of watching hours of tutorials.

## Features

- **Easy to understand almost "plug and play" UI:"** With the simplicity of tkinter, not only the UI is easy to use, but also the code is neatly organized and somewhat fast to understand for python beginers.
- **Almost all of the normal calculator options:** You can add, subtract, divide, multiply, exponentiate and use roots, but also you can change the brightness mode of the whole app and resize it.
- **Easy and fast access:** The app [as of 1.2.2] is lightweight alowing for quick start and usage. Only 11 KB!
- **Intuitive and simple screen:** The calculator has a quick and dynamic display alowing you to use this app in only one window.

## Tutorial

> TL;DR Just click the buttons!

### 1. Open the app and using the virtual keyboard type in your eqation

### 2. Click the "=" button

### *Tip: Use the "C" button to clear the display*

## Enhanced calculator

### I've started working on the new version aiming to allow for multiple operations in one go! You can see the newest version and the progress in the new branch.

### Currently done parts are:

- Enhanced display
- better widgets look and colors
- widgets resizing
- multiple operations in one go
- square roots

### To be done:

- other calculator modes

# Enjoy the app!
